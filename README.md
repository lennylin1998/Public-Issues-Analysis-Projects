# Project Folder Overview
The goal is to raise more attention on specific issues, or provide a different point of view to the public through **data visualization**. For tools I am using **Python** for acquiring data and data cleaning, and **Tableau** for visulization. Below are some highlights of my work. If you are interested in other works that I have done, make sure to visit my [Tableau Public Page](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lenny.lin#!/). Lastly, you are Welcome to leave any comment! Any suggestion would be very helpful to me. Have fun exploring data!:mag_right:

### Objective
Covid-19 Visualization are done by so many people, but mostly are under Country scope. There is barely an analysis specific to county/city. So I decided to create a dashboard for people to look deep into Covid-19 cases and vaccination rate by counties/cities.
